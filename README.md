###Observo — AI-Powered Violence Detection System

🚀 Project Overview
Observo is an AI-driven violence detection system that automatically monitors video feeds to identify violent or aggressive behavior in real time.
Built using cutting-edge computer vision and deep learning techniques, Observo aims to enhance security by providing early alerts and preventing escalation of incidents in public spaces, schools, workplaces, and other sensitive environments.

###🎯 Key Features
Real-time Violence Detection
Continuously analyzes live video feeds to detect physical violence or aggressive activities.

###High Accuracy Deep Learning Model
Trained on curated datasets featuring violent and non-violent scenes.

###Early Alert System
Instantly triggers an alert (sound, notification, or message) when violent activity is detected.

Customizable Thresholds
Set sensitivity levels according to the environment (e.g., more sensitive in schools, moderate in public parks).

Lightweight and Scalable
Optimized to run efficiently on moderate hardware as well as cloud servers.

###🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (main programming language)
PyTorch (deep learning frameworks)
OpenCV (video processing)
YOLOV8
Flask 


📄 Future Enhancements
Integrate face recognition for identifying individuals.

Improve model robustness in low-light or crowded scenes.

Develop a mobile version of Observo.

Implement multilingual alert messages.

🚨 Important Notes
Observo is a research-based project and should not be considered a full replacement for human monitoring in critical environments.

Ethical use of this system is highly encouraged.
